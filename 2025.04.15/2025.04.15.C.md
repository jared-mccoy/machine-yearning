I see.. see one thing i've been mulling over is a collaborative mind mapping app that would ideally use bleeding edge vector rendering to efficiently handle / load very large maps per context .. from this is not gamping per se but i feel that the performance question here and the fact that the ui is the graph essentially pushes it over into gaming esque space where i either need to use svg (painting?) to properly manage the visual load .. help me think through various approaches.. i'm open to new promising frameworks packages that have great success w algorithmic management of complex network graphs.. 

i've played around w a static web app that uses d3 , and i've played around w reactflow (sucks) , plus what i'm envisioining needs a strong interactive aspect (think n dimensional concept mapping and vs mind mapping)

open to all sorts of reccomendations here

For a high-performance, collaborative mind mapping tool with complex graph visualization, you're right to consider this closer to gaming tech than standard business apps. Here are targeted approaches:
Best Framework Options:
Three.js + WebGL
Highest performance for complex visual graphs
Can handle thousands of nodes with proper optimization
Works well with React for UI components surrounding the graph
Flutter with custom Canvas rendering
Better performance than React Native for large visual workloads
Custom painter API for efficient drawing
Cross-platform with consistent performance
Electron + PixiJS
PixiJS offers WebGL rendering with high performance
Desktop-specific optimizations possible
Can handle very large graphs with virtual rendering
Specialized Graph Libraries:
Cytoscape.js
Purpose-built for network visualization
Better performance than D3 for large graphs
Extensive layout algorithms
Sigma.js
WebGL-accelerated graph rendering
Optimized for larger datasets than D3
Good performance on mobile
NGX-Graph (if using Angular)
Force-directed layouts
Good performance characteristics
Data Management:
Quadtree/Octree spatial indexing
Essential for handling large graph collision detection
Reduces computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)
Web Workers
Offload layout calculations to background threads
Keep UI responsive during complex operations
WebAssembly modules
For truly performance-critical algorithms
Can be 10-100x faster than JavaScript for heavy computation
For Collaboration:
Y.js
CRDT-based real-time collaboration
Works well with graph structures
Handles offline/online seamlessly
Firestore + custom conflict resolution
More structured approach to collaboration
Good for larger user bases
For your specific n-dimensional concept mapping needs, I'd recommend:
Three.js/PixiJS + Y.js for a web/desktop solution
Flutter + custom rendering + Firebase for a cross-platform approach
Both would require custom work on graph layout algorithms and viewport management, but they're the most promising paths for handling the visualization complexity while maintaining performance.
cytoscape looks like trash . looks like it was designed on emacs

You're right about Cytoscape's default aesthetics - they're definitely dated and academic-looking. If visual quality is a priority (as it should be for a modern mind mapping tool), here are better alternatives with superior design capabilities:
Sigma.js - Much more modern visual aesthetic
WebGL rendering with custom shaders
Better default styling
vis.js - Cleaner, more contemporary look
More customizable visual elements
Better animation capabilities
ECharts (network module)
Very polished, modern aesthetics
Enterprise-grade rendering quality
GoJS
Commercial but extremely polished
Excellent interaction design
For a truly modern, visually striking approach:
Force Graph in Three.js
Complete visual customization
3D capabilities if needed
Beautiful particle effects, gradients, etc.
react-force-graph
Modern React wrapper around force-directed graphs
Clean, customizable aesthetics
The key would be to pair any of these with custom styling and animation. Most graph libraries focus on function over form in their demos, but with proper styling, several can produce beautiful results.
yeah so three.js is like THE go to for anything 3d written in js basically right

Yes, Three.js is absolutely the go-to standard for 3D in JavaScript. It dominates the space for several reasons:
Massive ecosystem and community (177K+ GitHub stars)
Extensive documentation and examples
Wide browser compatibility
Active development and maintenance
Handles complex 3D scenes efficiently through WebGL
Rich feature set (physics, animations, shaders, etc.)
Used by major companies (Google, Apple, Nike, etc.)
While alternatives exist (Babylon.js, PlayCanvas), Three.js remains the default choice for most developers working with 3D in web environments. It strikes an excellent balance between power and accessibility.
For your mind mapping project, Three.js would provide tremendous flexibility for creating visually striking and performant visualizations, especially if you want to incorporate any 3D elements or advanced visual effects that go beyond what 2D libraries can offer.
ok.. and my impression is that 3js would only be less optimarl than pixijs if the mapp were 2d only correct 

Correct. If your mind map is strictly 2D with no plans for 3D elements:
PixiJS would be more optimal because:
Lower overhead - designed specifically for 2D rendering
Faster rendering for large numbers of 2D sprites/elements
Better memory performance for purely 2D scenes
Simpler API for 2D-specific operations
More efficient batching for 2D elements
Three.js carries additional overhead from its 3D capabilities that aren't necessary for purely 2D visualization.
However, if there's any chance you might want to introduce 3D elements later (like visualizing concept hierarchies in 3D space, or adding depth for emphasis), starting with Three.js would provide more flexibility for future expansion.
For a purely 2D mind mapping solution focused on maximum performance with thousands of nodes, PixiJS would indeed be the more optimized choice.
ok and as far as different envs (web, mobile, desktop -- is there a more technical term for this , its not just cross platform per se is it) 

is threejs a viable backend framework across implementations  or does it default for certain 

The technical term you're looking for is "cross-environment" or "multi-platform runtime environments."
Regarding Three.js across environments:
Three.js is primarily designed for web browsers (DOM/WebGL environment), but it can be adapted to work across different environments with some considerations:
Web: Native environment, works perfectly (browsers)
Desktop (Electron):
Excellent compatibility
Native performance through Chrome's V8/WebGL
Mobile Web:
Works but with performance limitations
Device capability differences
Mobile Apps (React Native):
Requires bridges like react-native-threejs
Performance hit from the JavaScript bridge
WebGL limitations on some devices
Flutter:
No direct integration
Would require custom Flutter plugins
Three.js doesn't have a native implementation for each platform - it's fundamentally a browser-based library that can be adapted to other environments. For truly optimal cross-environment performance, you might need:
Web/Desktop: Three.js directly
React Native: A specialized React Native port or bridge
Flutter: A completely different implementation using Flutter's canvas
This fragmentation across runtime environments is why some companies build twice (native mobile + web) despite the extra development cost.
yeah but if mobile app is a lesser priority then it sounds like three js is more than viable and even w mobile it at least has some preexisting frameworkd for threejs vs flutter which would be entirely new build

You're absolutely right. If mobile is a lower priority, Three.js provides an excellent path forward:
Web + Desktop (Electron): Native Three.js implementation with optimal performance
Mobile Web: Serviceable experience without additional development
Mobile App (React Native): Functional but not optimal experience using existing bridges
The key advantages of this approach:
Single codebase for your core visualization engine
No need to learn an entirely new tech stack for different platforms
Leverage your JavaScript/Three.js expertise across environments
Huge existing ecosystem of Three.js plugins/examples
Start with perfect web/desktop experience, then optimize mobile later if needed
The existing React Native bridges for Three.js (like react-native-three) aren't perfect, but they provide a viable path that's much more efficient than rebuilding everything in Flutter.
This approach lets you focus your resources on making an exceptional web/desktop experience first, with a functional mobile offering, rather than splitting efforts across completely different implementations.
ok so three js sounds like the main building block.. what do you think regarding the actual architecture though .. here's what i want 

1) simple very fast n dimensional prototyping (cf @https://vue.tufts.edu/ which is java based, primarily 2d but with a strong eye to 3d , say default canvas 2d but w a 3d camera)
2) ability to pull / push updates to neo4j <> mongo (i already have a codebase for maintaing something like polyglot persistence between neo4j and mongo and have a strong interst in integration w apps like Obsidian that do a kind of md based knowledge base network graphing .. mongo i see as the natural lingua franca between md knoweledgebase ws static web deployment (via quartz e.g.) and this more performant , potentially 3d environment i'm imagining which needs to sync with these kinds of existing kms and via a more 3d graph native env
3) the real cherry on top: being able to render complex movements of 3d vector animations quickly and performantly by essentially creating a coarse sequence of constellations (e.g. clone current , adjust postitons of nodes, interpolate between) and add fine adjustements to discrete timing (new nodes appear one by one per coarse layout, or have certain one off animations) . i have an implementation of this that runs in after effects . it works but gets absolutely killed on the performance side of things when i'm dealing w say 50+ nodes , i know that it is technically possible to render what takes AE like 5 hours in a matter of minutes or even in real time at a dimished frame rate if i am very careful about my architectural choices (which is why i'm especially interested in gaming type engines esp if they outperform 3js and offer comperable cross env/platform benefits 

Based on your detailed requirements, I'll outline an architecture that would work well for this advanced knowledge mapping system:
Core Architecture Recommendation
Rendering Layer
Three.js remains your best foundation for requirements that blend 2D/3D with complex animations:
Apply to Untitled-1
For your specific animation needs, Three.js's animation system with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) would provide the performance for complex node transitions.
Data Architecture
Apply to Untitled-1
Specific Technical Components
Fast n-dimensional prototyping
Three.js with custom shader materials for optimal rendering
Force-directed layout algorithms with WebWorkers for background processing
Canvas-based rendering with WebGL acceleration (similar to VUE from Tufts)
Spatial partitioning algorithms (Quadtree) for collision detection
Polyglot Persistence & Integration
Neo4j/MongoDB sync via change streams on server
CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for offline collaboration
Integration with Obsidian via plugin API + Markdown parsing
GraphQL API for data exchange to handle complex nested queries efficiently
Vector Animation Performance
Instanced mesh rendering for nodes (crucial for performance with 50+ nodes)
GPU-based animation calculations via custom shaders
Level-of-detail optimizations for distant nodes
Frame-skipping for complex animations based on system performance
Implementation Strategy
Start with Electron + Three.js + GSAP for the desktop version
Add IndexedDB for local storage
Build Neo4j/MongoDB sync layer
Implement Obsidian plugin API integration
Add WebGL shaders for custom animations
Optimize with WebWorkers for layout calculations
Add React Native bridge if mobile becomes higher priority
The VUE concept mapping tool from Tufts you referenced is a good model, but your approach with Three.js + modern web technologies would deliver significantly better performance and flexibility.
For the complex vector animations, Three.js can easily handle 50+ animated nodes in real-time through instanced rendering and efficient buffering - far outperforming After Effects for this specific use case.
Using this architecture, you'd be able to create a system that not only meets your current needs but provides headroom for more advanced features in the future.
tell me a little more about green sock / indexedDb/loki js and how these relate to neo4j / mongo , are they a new layer or could they potentially replace neo4j , i'm not married to neo just thinking of it as one of the more performant graph dbs available 

Let me explain these technologies and how they relate to your database stack:
GreenSock (GSAP)
GSAP is an animation library that works alongside Three.js - it's not a database:
Extremely performant animation system (10-20× faster than CSS animations)
Handles complex sequencing, easing, and timeline management
Perfect for your node transition animations
Works client-side only; doesn't replace any database
IndexedDB vs LokiJS
These are client-side storage solutions that function as a local cache:
IndexedDB:
Browser's built-in NoSQL database
Persistent client-side storage (survives browser restarts)
Good for offline-first applications
Limited query capabilities compared to MongoDB
LokiJS:
In-memory JavaScript database with persistence
Much faster queries than IndexedDB
Document-oriented like MongoDB
Better for complex querying needs
Both serve as local caches that sync with your backend databases. They don't replace Neo4j/MongoDB but rather provide:
Offline functionality
Performance optimization
Reduced server load
Instant UI updates
Relationship to Neo4j/MongoDB
Your database architecture could be:
Apply to Untitled-1
Graph Database Options:
Neo4j:
Mature, highly optimized for graph operations
Excellent for complex graph traversals
Higher operational complexity
ACID-compliant with powerful query language (Cypher)
MongoDB (with graph capabilities):
MongoDB 5.0+ has basic graph capabilities
Simpler to operate than Neo4j
Better document storage
Less performant for complex graph queries
Could potentially be your single database if graph queries aren't extremely complex
ArangoDB:
Multi-model database (documents, graphs, key-value)
Could replace both Neo4j and MongoDB
Less mature than Neo4j for pure graph operations
Simpler architecture (one database instead of two)
Recommendation
For your specific needs:
Client: Use LokiJS (faster than IndexedDB for graph operations)
Server: Consider ArangoDB if you want to simplify your architecture
If you need absolute peak performance for complex graph operations, Neo4j is still the standard. But for most applications, the complexity of maintaining separate graph and document databases might not be worth it compared to using a multi-model DB like ArangoDB or even MongoDB with its graph capabilities.
The key is that LokiJS/IndexedDB are always local caches, not replacements for your server-side database strategy.
i'm curious do you think using mongo + loki could be as/more performant vs neo4j as backend 

i like neo4j in theory if it really is as cutting edge performant as they say, but i find it kind of annoying in its niche , supplemental nature and woudl prefer to use something with greater breadth and versatility (mongo) if the latter can be rigged up appropriately 

For your use case, Mongo + LokiJS could absolutely match or exceed Neo4j's performance while providing greater versatility. Here's why:
MongoDB + LokiJS vs. Neo4j
Performance Considerations
Read-heavy operations: MongoDB's recent improvements with graph queries are comparable to Neo4j for most practical scenarios
MongoDB: Faster for simple neighborhood queries and general document retrieval
Neo4j: Still superior for complex multi-hop traversals (5+ hops)
Write Performance:
MongoDB significantly outperforms Neo4j for write operations
Critical for collaborative tools with frequent updates
Scaling:
MongoDB's horizontal scaling is much more mature than Neo4j's clustering
Better for growing user bases
LokiJS as the Performance Multiplier
LokiJS as your client-side cache creates a compound advantage:
Most frequent operations happen locally at memory speed
Only changes sync back to MongoDB
Graph traversals can be optimized in-memory
Practical Architecture Benefits
Versatility:
MongoDB handles documents, basic graphs, and binary data in one system
Simpler operational model (one database technology to manage)
More familiar to most developers
Ecosystem:
Larger community, more tools, better cloud provider support
Better integration with modern JavaScript stacks
MongoDB Atlas:
Fully managed service with excellent scaling
Built-in backup, monitoring, and security
Implementation Strategy
Apply to Untitled-1
Unless you're building something requiring extremely complex graph algorithms (like path-finding across massive networks), the MongoDB + LokiJS approach will likely be:
More than performant enough
Significantly easier to develop with
More versatile for your mixed data needs (knowledge graphs + rich content)
Better supported in the JavaScript ecosystem
The performance gap between Neo4j and MongoDB for graph operations has narrowed substantially in recent versions, making Neo4j's specialized nature harder to justify unless you have very specific advanced graph needs.
yeah and on top of that my primary existing knolwedgebase architecture is already highly normalized mongo w document nodes and oid keys for relations.. so its a little unusual vs the denormalized mongo docs you typically see 

That's a perfect match then! Your existing normalized MongoDB architecture with document nodes and OID keys for relations is exactly what you'd want for a graph-oriented application.
This approach combines the best of both worlds:
Graph structure benefits:
Clean separation of nodes and relationships
Efficient traversal through normalized references
Easier to maintain complex relationship types
MongoDB benefits:
Superior performance for document operations
Better scaling characteristics
More flexible schema evolution
Your existing MongoDB architecture is essentially already implementing a graph model within MongoDB. This is more sophisticated than the typical denormalized approach and aligns perfectly with graph database principles.
With LokiJS as your client-side cache, you'd be able to:
Mirror this normalized structure in memory
Perform high-speed traversals locally
Sync changes back to your existing MongoDB structure
This is an ideal situation because:
No need to migrate existing data
No new database technology to learn
You're already using MongoDB in a graph-optimized way
Your application code can remain consistent
Given that your knowledge base is already structured this way, adding Neo4j would be redundant and introduce unnecessary complexity. Your normalized MongoDB approach is already providing the structural benefits that people typically turn to Neo4j for.
This confirms that MongoDB + LokiJS is definitely the right approach for your specific situation.
